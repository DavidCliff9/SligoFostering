            <h2 class="Heading">Fostering Dogs</h2>

            <p>Fostering dogs is one of the best things a dog lover could do. Fostering a dog means you take home and provide shelter and care for a certain amount of time until their forever home is found. It can be a good way to get experience having a dog as a pet before committing to your own, whilst helping dogs in need. Dogs fostered out from shelters are typically too stressed by the shelter enviorment and need individual attention until they're ready and build up trust with humans again. Another reason is the shelter can be overcrowded, fostering a dog frees up space for more dogs to be saved.

            <h2 class="Heading">Feeding</h2>
            <p>It can be difficult to pick out what to feed your dog, as there are many brands and flavours. While the exact type of food will depend on the dog, the expert advice is to stick to 2 meals per day. Puppies will need 4 meals spreadout throughout the day as they are still developing. Target food high in protein and fiber. This chart can serve as a guideline of what to look for and serving sizes:</p>

            <p>Walking your dog is one of the best activites you can do for your dog. Not only is it good low impact exercise, it also allows your dog to socialise with other dogs and humans. This allows them to come out of their shell while getting the exercise they require. Sligo has a lot of parks you can bring your dog to, one of the best is Doorly park, With one 2km loop, a second loop in the woods and another route with stairs, walkers say this is the best place to walk your dog.</p>
            <p>Doorly park has a lot of green area for you to play fetch, another good exercise for your dog that is easy to play with when trained to bring the dog back. It'll allow your dog to run and meet other dogs off the leash.</p>
            <p>Exercise can also be done indoors, you can buy various squeaker toys, balls and durable rope for tug of war that your dog can use in their room if you have one safe for the dog to play with.</p>
