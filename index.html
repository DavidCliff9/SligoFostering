            <p>Puppies are doggone adorable, sure — but caring for a puppy, even for a short period, certainly isn’t a walk in the dog park. Young puppies present unique challenges, from potty training accidents to destructive behaviors and everything in between.

                Carli’s advice to new foster pet parents? Avoid taking in a puppy, and consider fostering an adult or senior dog instead.
                
                “I recommend avoiding puppies at the start as they tend to be a lot more work and need much more attention than older dogs,” explains Carli. “Plus, older dogs have a harder time getting fostered and adopted so are much more in need of your help!”
                
                She’s right — puppies are the most “pawpular” adoption candidates. Compared to adult dogs, puppies are less likely to be returned to shelters for behavioral issues. Meanwhile, adult dogs returned to shelters are 4 times more likely to be euthanized than puppies.
                
                So instead of taking in a puppy as your first foster dog, consider fostering an at-risk older dog instead. Adult dogs in shelters often receive some training and veterinary care, which will make your job as a foster pet parent much easier. Plus, as you gain more experience, you’ll be better equipped to handle a boisterous puppy!<a href="https://wagwalking.com/daily/10-tips-for-fostering-a-dog-advice-from-real-foster-pet-parents">Learn more</a></p>
